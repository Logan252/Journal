# Weekly Learning Journal

## Task Summary

### Child Theme Creation
This week, I developed a child theme for the assignment website. Although I subsequently removed it to ensure my understanding of reverting changes if issues arise, it is not currently applied to any project. Additionally, I dedicated time to watching LinkedIn and YouTube videos.

## Time Allocation

### Estimated Hours
Approximately 6 hours were spent this week, slightly below the weekly target of 8. However, I had previously invested time in this topic two weeks ago, as it organically emerged during study.

## Insights

### Child Theme Benefits
Child themes offer flexibility in modifying existing themes without altering the main theme files directly. This enables customization without permanently modifying the original design. Edits made within child themes are preserved and unaffected by updates to the parent theme. By utilizing a child theme, modifications are stored separately, ensuring that updates can still be applied to the main theme without compromising user customizations. Key considerations when creating a child theme include naming conventions, downloading the original theme, and adding necessary information in functions.php.

### Enqueuing Parent Theme Stylesheet
It is common for developers to use functions.php for CSS rather than styles.css. Enqueuing the parent theme's stylesheet in the child theme's functions.php ensures proper inheritance of styles from the parent theme.

## Career Insights

### Role of Child Themes
Child themes are essential tools in a web designer's toolkit, safeguarding against reverted changes and updates. Although I do not intend to pursue web development as a primary career path, I recognize their importance for potential side projects. Integrating child theme knowledge with e-strategic management (CP3401) could provide a comprehensive solution for clients, leveraging SEO and marketing strategies.
