Content Insights

Joomla 5 has a different menu layout than 4. % was released in 2023, so chat GPT or a majority of youtube videos will focus on 4. 

"Joomla 5 extension installation using sticky bar notification module and plugin activation" 

Extensions are trickier to find in 5 as it is not one of th emain menu tabs. Need to go to system, then extensions and upload the extension files.

Once uploaded, go to system, site modules, 
or I have pinned it to the main menu.
