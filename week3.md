Learning Activities & Resources

This week I recreated my website within wordpress and made the site live.
I studied the LinkedIn learning course as well as the following:
- Host a Wordpress Website on AWS using Amazon Lightsail (For Only $3.50 a month!)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49aOUHkvlgg
- Amazon Lightsail vs EC2 - What's the difference and When to Use What?
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=COK3ko4np-0 
- How to Create AWS LIGHTSAIL WORDPRESS INSTANCE - AWS LIGHTSAIL WITH CUSTOM DOMAIN
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f2Hl2u9GAvw&t=506s
- https://www.linkedin.com/learning/wordpress-5-essential-training/install-and-running-wordpress?resume=false


- google doc for group discussion in class
- https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VxR5L1C0E4kzTZeoEWteo9mRG5MvPO82UgzaVfm_QQk/edit

There was also much related to employability within the lecture that will be useful for interview preperation.

Estimated time
I spent about 3 hours working on the site, 4 hours on the AWS lightsail and about 6 hours in video content. 

Content insights.
AWS was a good hosting serivce to begin with, it is well documented on the website and there are articles for every step. It is very easy to make small mistakes and is important to note that not everyhting is done just in lightsail but also route 53. 

More time is needed to research how the Value/route traffic bar operates.

Career/Employability/Learning Insights
After completing this practical, I have had to reschedule my study timetable, as the content is too large for 2 days. There is another LinkedIn course that runs through child themes, posts etc that would be useful to know before being creating more of the website. The employability discussion through the lecture was useful and will refer back mid next week as a refresher. Key note: don't say qualities you have, demonstrate them. Saying I am reliable is pointless, no one is going to say "I'm not reliable, give me the job".

The following schedule should get everything back on track.
Tuesday will be scheduled for these videos, wednesday will be research for the assignment, thursday for assignemnt work, friday lecture, saturday sunday for practical work and leftover time for the assignment.
