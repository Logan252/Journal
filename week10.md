# Week 10
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week we were to peform a rehearsal for the presentation. The group had agreed to use OBS as it is easy to splice and merge multiple recordings.

## Estimated time
Approximately 5 hours went into the presentation. This mostly came from having to do multiple takes and rewriting the scipts.

## Content Insights
The OBS recording software was user friendly and easy to install. I had to use a mac to record my parts, while the opther team members used windows. This did not affect the
merging process, although we did have to convert the file. 

Some technical issues arose with the recording, and moving the usb to the front or top of the PC instead of having them at the back sold these issues. 

It was important for the group to do a at least 3 takes, as most of the iterations would not be of any value. 
An issue that repeated itself through this task was that the presentation kept going out of scope. 
At the beginning of the rehearsal, the scope should have been clearly defined using the tools provieded (such as a marking rubric),
and a conversation should have taken place much earlier about how we each demonstrated how our content was related. 

### Presentation iterations
The team was all designated a section, scipts and powerpoints were made for the first rehearsal. After viewing the first take, I pointed out that a powerpoint was not 
enough to replace a live demonstration, so we had to re write the scripts and go again.

The second iteration included some live demonstrations on some of the processes, and upon viewing again, we decided that half a demonstration makes little sense to the 
audience.

On the third iteration, we allowed some freedom of choice for the team on how they wanted to do their section. Although this is not a bad idea, we encountered an issue
of some team members not demonstrating anything related to the presentation. 

For the final iteration, we did the entire demonstration and only discussed related material. The rubric was carefully read by everyone in the group and all scripts were 
checked by the group before recording.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
These communication and leadership skills are something an employer will value, and I should strive to keep on top of small mistakes such as those listed above.
It is also worth noting, that to point out these mistakes must be done with care, as how people interpret criticism can vary, and that giving criticism is a 
industry skill in itself.
