The following is a complete guide on how to set this up if required in the future.

## Estimated time
Spent 3 hours on our first meeting as a team. Spent an additional hour to gather resources and create the journal entry. 

## Content Insights

Integrating Trello, Slack, and GitHub optimizes workflows, promoting collaboration and transparency. Notifications from Trello cards, GitHub repositories, and Slack channels keep teams informed in real-time, enhancing communication and enabling efficient issue tracking and resolution. 

To connect Trello, there is an extension to install called "Trello Alerts".
For long term projects, Slack hides messages and files that are over 90 days, so it may be useful to either purchase the PRO version or find an alternative. 
Trello also has a paywall that limits to 10 collaborators and how many extensions may be used.

In a proffesional environment, this should not be an issue. Just something that needs to be resolved early on to avoid complications. 
  
### Meeting schedule/ Trello
As I am responsible for the meeting schedules and the initial set up of Trello, I have broken it up into two meetings in the beginning weeks. 
Wednesedays at 8:30, a short meeting that will go for 20-40 minutes is what we will use for our "stand up meetings". This is to see if everyone is keeping
on top of there work and if there is any blockages we should become aware of.
It also allows us to decide wether the following Saturday or Sunday will be suitable for the major meeting, as the groups schedules varies.

I am also responsible for organising a 1 on 1 catch up meeting if anyone is unable to attend. As per the group policy, it is acceptable to miss one, 
but communication is important.

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
Collaborating within a team of peers, all of us nearing completion of our final year, resembles working with senior members rather than novices. This dynamic necessitates adaptive group management tactics, subtly suggesting ideas for adoption rather than imposing them. Such strategies are invaluable in professional settings, where seasoned employees often prefer ideas from experienced colleagues. Utilizing and optimizing modern tools like Trello, Slack, and GitHub during this assignment enhances readiness for professional environments. Moreover, the project's scale offers practical experience in project management, further bolstering career readiness.
