### Quick guide to set up server for php. 
This method uses xampp, which will require the path to the application file C:\xampp\php\php.exe. Then in the php server extension, go to the extension settings, 
set the phpserver to 0.0.0.0. and the php path to the Xamp path given previously. The port should be 3000. 
Install the Live Server Web Extension in the web browser and change the settings to live upload, actual server adress to localhost:3000 and 
the live server address to 127.0.0.1:5500. 
In the php file, right click and click phpserver: server project then click "go live" in the bottom right corner. 
This will bring you to the files online, go to a new tab and type http://localhost:3000/ and the path for the file.
In this case it is http://localhost:3000/theadviceshop-master/index.php. 

## Estimated time
Team meetings went for 4 hours in total this week. An additional 4 hours for the practical. 2 hours on videos. 

## Content Insights
PHP is primarily used for server-side scripting, meaning that PHP code is executed on the server before the resulting HTML is sent to the client's web browser. This allows for efficient processing of data, secure handling of sensitive information, and seamless integration with databases and other server-side technologies.

The language has a lot of built in functionality with wordpress through php storm and should consider moving to php storm for the assignment. 
The syntax is straight forward and easy to learn. 

The biggest challenge is that it does requrie significantly more work and knowledge to set up, as PHP requires a server to use. 

### Career/Employability/Learning Insights
PHP is a widely-used programming language for web development, offering advantages such as extensive documentation, improved loading speed, and compatibility with various databases and cloud services. However, it faces challenges such as declining popularity among developers, lack of specialized libraries, and security concerns. Despite this, PHP remains a cost-effective and flexible choice for web development.

As it is apart of a 48% of wordpress websites and even apart of big companies such as Facebook, it does offer some career paths if I chose to specaialise.
